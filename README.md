# iphone-backup-extractor

The extractor works for extracting all domains in iOS backups. Please keep in mind that this is just a simple implementation of the iOSbackup library and I do not take any reponsibility for the loss of your data (though I tested it multiple times and I didn't experience any data loss).

For more information check: https://pypi.org/project/iOSbackup/

If you have any suggestions for better a experience with extracting backups don't hesitate to make a PR or contact me on my socials.

Enjoy!
